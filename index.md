### CPSC 120

* Lab 9

    For lab 9 in part 2 involved creating a secret numbers game. But 
    we were also asked to manipulate another file which made this new 
    way of performing a previous assignment memorable.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10 part 1 stood out because of its focus on California counties.
    Where we were given California counties and their respective populations.
    And used vectors to organize the information given.

* Lab 6

    Part 2 of lab 6 was very memorable. We were asked to create a game of 
    blackjack and calculate the value of cards using functions. It was very 
    interesting to code a game I had played so many times before with my friends.
